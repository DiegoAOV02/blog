We’re about to finish another year, and for me, this one was a roller coaster of learning.

To start, I began working while also closing out my final year of college. I was nervous about taking this new step in my life—talking with professionals who know exactly what they’re doing and supporting them with my knowledge of coding and analysis.

My first job has had a huge impact on me. I’ve grown a lot in my ability to think critically, solve the problems I face, and push myself to deliver better results.

I’m genuinely happy with this moment in my life, where I’m learning every day and trying to give my best.

I know things are going well, and this year has shown me that. The most important thing about all the challenges I’ve encountered is that I’ve always gotten back up and refused to be afraid or embarrassed by my mistakes.

Maybe it’s still a bit early to reflect on the year, but I’m grateful for everything that has happened. This year taught me that no matter how big or overwhelming a problem seems, I can handle it—and I’ll learn something valuable from it so I know how to face it next time.

This month, I’ve been listening to a lot of music from the ’80s, especially Queen. It had been a long time since I listened to their songs, and one in particular makes me feel powerful and helps me start my day with good energy: _Don't Stop Me Now_.
