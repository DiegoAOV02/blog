When we are working everyday with the terminal of our computer, sometimes we want to customize our terminal to be more about ourselves and be really worth it when we need to use it.

In this post. We are going to customize our current mac terminal by using **Oh My Zsh** and **PowerLevel10K**. I found this tutorial on YouTube some time ago, so all the credits goes for this guy: https://www.josean.com/posts/terminal-setup

## Prerequisites:

- Homebrew
- Git
- Visual Studio Code

## Install Oh My Zsh

Open Terminal, copy and paste this code to install Oh My Zsh:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Install PowerLevel10K for Oh My Zsh

Copy and paste this code to install PowerLevel10K

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Then, open the file "~/.zshrc" on your VSCode with:

> You need to enable the use of 'code' keyword on your computer to access the file and modified.

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

After access the file. You need to modify the value of ZSH_THEME as shown in this:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

Run this command to activate this changes.

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Start configuring your terminal.

After activate your changes, you will see on your terminal the wizard to start customize your terminal. **Please** if you see the first three figures you must be clear in order to start customizing your terminal. In this context everybody can set their own colors, theme, etc. So the only thing I suggest you to activate is 'Verbose'.

## EXTRA: Useful ZSH Plugins

zsh-autosuggestions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

zsh-syntax-highlight:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Once you cloned the plugins, open again '~/.zshrc' file with VSCode and modify the plugins as you see below:

```bash
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting web-search)
```

Load the changes on the file with:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

And that's how you can personalize your terminal!
